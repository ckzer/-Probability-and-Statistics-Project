# Probability-and-Statistics-Project

1. Generate one population of more than 1000 elements having normal distribution with specific mean(𝜇) and variance(𝜎^2).
   • Draw graphs of both real data and probability distribution.
2. Randomly sample 10 samples / 30 samples / 61 samples from population 5 times. For each case,
   • Calculate sample mean(𝑋) and sample variance(𝑆^2).
   • Calculate mean of sample mean (𝐸(𝑋)) and mean of sample variance (𝐸(𝑆^2)).
3. Generate two populations of more than 1000 elements having normal
   distribution with specific mean(𝜇1, 𝜇2) and equal variance(𝜎1^2 = 𝜎2^2).
   • Draw graphs of both real data and probability distribution.
4. Randomly sample 81 and 101 samples from two population respectively, and using sampling distribution, estimate the difference between two population means (𝜇1 − 𝜇2) with 95% confidence interval.
   • Assuming we know the population variance (𝜎1^2, 𝜎2^2)
   • Assuming we don’t know the population variance but we know both are same
   • Assuming we don’t know the population variance
5. Randomly sample 81 and 101 samples from two population respectively, and using sampling distribution, estimate the ratio of two variances between two population means (𝜎1^2/𝜎2^2) with 95% confidence interval.
